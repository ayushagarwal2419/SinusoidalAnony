# SinusoidalAnony



The subjective study is performed to check the intelligibility and originality of anonymized speech. From the TIMIT and IITG-MV dataset, $1$ utterance of $4$ speakers for each of the $5$ cases of complementary speech were taken. We have $1 \times 4 \times 5 = 20$ utterances for each dataset. Therefore, we have $40$ speech utterances in total. For every subject, a pair of speech files are played one by one; the first is natural speech, and the other is anonymized speech. The study was done on $10$ listeners, and they had to give the score according to their intelligibility and criteria listed in table below. The mean opinion score (MOS) for all the cases is computed. The closer the MOS is to $5$, the better the intelligibility.
